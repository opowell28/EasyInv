# EasyInv
A simple inventory tool intended to improve inventory taking at my day job.
Currently, I take inventory by filling out a spreadsheet one cell at a time. This tool should streamline that process significantly.

## Thinking Thoughts
- I want to be able to update inventory as it is sold
- Want main page to display current inventory
